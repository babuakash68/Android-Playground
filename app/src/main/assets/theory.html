    <h1>Four Pillars of Android</h1>
    <p>Android's architecture is built on four fundamental components, known as the Four Pillars. These components are the building blocks of every Android application, each serving a specific purpose in the app's functionality.</p>

    <div class="pillar">
        <h3>1. Activities</h3>
        <p>Activities represent the user interface of your app. Each screen in your app is typically a separate Activity. Activities are the entry points for user interaction and are managed in a stack known as the back stack.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Example: A login screen, a home screen, or a settings screen are all separate Activities.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
        <h3>2. Services</h3>
        <p>Services are components that run in the background to perform long-running operations without a user interface. They can continue running even when the user switches to another app.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Example: Playing music in the background, downloading files, or syncing data with a server.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
        <h3>3. Broadcast Receivers</h3>
        <p>Broadcast Receivers respond to system-wide events and custom broadcasts. They allow your app to respond to events that happen outside your app's normal flow.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Example: Responding to battery low events, network connectivity changes, or custom events from other apps.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="pillar">
        <h3>4. Content Providers</h3>
        <p>Content Providers manage shared app data and allow other apps to access it. They provide a standard interface for data access and sharing between applications.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <p>Example: Accessing the device's contacts, calendar, or media files, or sharing your app's data with other apps.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>How They Work Together</h2>
    <p>These four components work together to create a complete Android application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Activities provide the user interface and handle user interactions</li>
        <li>Services handle background tasks and long-running operations</li>
        <li>Broadcast Receivers respond to system events and custom broadcasts</li>
        <li>Content Providers manage and share data between apps</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Keep Activities focused on UI and user interaction</li>
        <li>Use Services for background tasks that don't need user interaction</li>
        <li>Register Broadcast Receivers dynamically when possible</li>
        <li>Implement Content Providers when you need to share data with other apps</li>
    </ul>
